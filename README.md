# Travel-Agency-Database-System

This is a database project based on the topic Travel Agency System. This repo consists of all the required code to create this database and also the ER diagram and Relational Dependencies for better visualization.

## Specifications:

This Database System is for a Travel Agency System called ‘Travel Agency’ located in the United Arab Emirates. For this we require a Customer’s Personal Details as well as their Travel Details to be entered into our system. When a Customer decides on which Package they want to avail, a Booking is made for them.

Our Database provides Packages to a Customer based on the location they wish to travel to. Packages come with multiple hotels for a destination. We also provide an option of Activities that a Customer can choose ranging from sightseeing to entertainment.

The Entity Sets we have started off with is Customer - contains personal and contact details of a customer, Customer Travel Details - contains a customer’s passport details, Booking- contains booking id, start and end date of the travel booking required and the price of it, Package- contains details about the package such as package id , Airplane- contains information about flight details, such as FlightNo, departure time, etc, Hotel- contains information about the hotel where the customer will be staying and Activity- contains information about the activities provided in the package in the rquired destination.
